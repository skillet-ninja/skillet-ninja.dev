##Skillet Ninja

Skillet Ninja is a virtual cooking assistant web application developed as a capstone project over the course of two weeks as part of a sixteen week intensive coding experience at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas. The team of three developers created a web app users can speak to and have their recipes read back to them. 

#How to use

Uses can look through the community recipes but must login in to create, edit or use the Virtual Cooking Assistant (VCA). Registered users can get to the VCA by clicking on the Start button on any recipe card. Recipe narration and/or voice commands can be turned off. Recipes are displayed and read to the cook step by step. Users can also click the timer button if a step has an associated timed cooking event.

##Technologies

Skillet Ninja's front end functionality was built using HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and the microlibraries of annyang.js, and bootstrap-tagsinput. 

The back end was built using a Laravel framework for our PHP which powered our SQL database.
