##Skillet Ninja

Skillet Ninja is a Virtual Cooking Assistant (VCA) web application developed as a capstone project over the course of two weeks as part of a sixteen-week intensive coding experience at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas. It was made by a team of three developers. The VCA has the ability to read recipes to users and accept their voice commands.


#How to use

Users can look through the community recipes but must login in to create, edit, or use the Virtual Cooking Assistant (VCA). Registered users can get to the VCA by clicking on the Start button on any recipe card. Recipe narration and/or voice commands can be turned off. Recipes can be displayed and read to the user step by step. Users can also click the timer button if a step has an associated timed cooking event.


##Technologies

Skillet Ninja's front end functionality was built using HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and the microlibraries: annyang.js, bootstrap-tagsinput, and parsley.js.
The back end was built using a Laravel framework for our PHP which powered our SQL database.
